# SimpleCardGame
Trying out functional WebSockets with Cats, Fs2, Blaze and more

This is a simple prototype of a game where you draw a card and bet if you have higher card than the computer. 

Doesnt compile because of some json formatters that I didnt get to fixing.


Note: Screwed up the .git folder and lost some commits
